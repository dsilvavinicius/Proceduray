# DirectX-Graphics-Samples
This repo contains the DirectX Graphics samples that demonstrate how to build graphics intensive applications for Windows 10.

## API Samples
In the Samples directory, you will find samples that attempt to break off specific features and specific usage scenarios into bite sized chunks. For example, the ExecuteIndirect sample will show you just enough about execute indirect to get started with that feature without diving too deep into multiengine whereas the nBodyGravity sample will delve into multiengine without touching on the execute indirect feature etc. By doing this, we hope to make it easier to get started with DirectX 12.

## Requirements
* Windows 10
* Visual Studio 2015 with the Windows 10 SDK
