# Hello World Samples
This collection of samples act as an introduction to Direct3D 12. Each sample introduces an elementary concept and lays a foundation for all of the Direct3D 12 samples.
## Hello Window Sample
This sample shows you how to create a window, Direct3D device (with debug layers enabled), and present to the window. These are the basic elements that every sample uses.
## Hello Triangle Sample
This sample shows you how to draw a static triangle using a vertex buffer.
## Hello Texture Sample
This sample shows you how to apply a Texture2D to triangle.
## Hello Bundles Sample
This sample shows you how to use Bundles to draw a static triangle more efficiently.
## Hello Constant Buffers Sample
This sample shows you how to animate a triangle using a constant buffer.
## Hello Frame Buffering Sample
This sample shows you how to use fences and multiple allocators to queue up multiple frames to the GPU.
