# Dynamic Indexing Sample
This sample demonstrates the use of new features available in HLSL's Shader Model 5.1 - specifically dynamic indexing and unbounded descriptor tables. With dynamic indexing, shaders can now index into an array without knowing the value of the index at compile time. When combined with unbounded arrays, this adds another level of indirection and flexibility for shader authors and art pipelines.

### Optional Features
This sample has been updated to build against the Windows 10 Anniversary Update SDK. In this SDK a new revision of Root Signatures is available for Direct3D 12 apps to use. Root Signature 1.1 allows for apps to declare when descriptors in a descriptor heap won't change or the data descriptors point to won't change.  This allows the option for drivers to make optimizations that might be possible knowing that something (like a descriptor or the memory it points to) is static for some period of time.
