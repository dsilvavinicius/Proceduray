# 11 on 12 Sample
This sample demonstrates how to use Direct3D 11 based rendering in combination with Direct3D 12 by sharing devices, command queues and resources between the 2 API versions. The sample illustrates this by using Direct2D to render a UI over Direct3D 12 content. This ability to share resources between runtimes makes porting apps/engines to 12 simpler as entire 11-based components, such as a UI system, can remain virtually untouched.
