# D3D12 Raytracing Samples
This collection of samples act as an introduction to DirectX Raytracing (DXR). The samples are divided into tutorials and advanced samples. Each tutorial sample introduces a few new DXR concepts. Advanced samples demonstrate more complex techniques and applications of raytracing. We will be adding more samples in the coming future, so check back. In addition, you can find more DXR samples tutorials at [Nvidia's DXR samples Github](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/DxrTutorials).

The samples are implemented using both DXR and D3D12 Raytracing Fallback Layer APIs. This is purely for demonstration purposes to show API differences. Real-world applications will implement only one or the other. The Fallback Layer uses DXR if a driver and OS supports it. Otherwise, it falls back to the compute pipeline to emulate raytracing. Developers aiming for wider HW support should target the Fallback Layer.

### Getting Started
* DXR spec/documentation is available in the SDK package at [Getting Started with Raytracing](http://forums.directxtech.com/index.php?topic=5860.0) post.
* [Raytracing Fallback Layer documentation](../../../Libraries/D3D12RaytracingFallback/readme.md).

# Tutorial Samples
## 1. [Hello World Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingHelloWorld/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to setup a raytracing pipeline and render a triangle in screen space.

## 2. [Simple Lighting Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingSimpleLighting/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to do ray generation for a dynamic perspective camera and calculate simple diffuse shading for a cube from a dynamic point light.

## 3. [Procedural Geometry Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingProceduralGeometry/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates how to implement procedural geometry using intersection shaders and shows usage of more complex shader table layouts and multiple ray types.

# Advanced Samples

## [MiniEngine Sample](src/D3D12RaytracingMiniEngineSample/readme.md)
This sample demonstrates integration of the Fallback Layer in the MiniEngine's Model Viewer and several sample uses of raytracing.

## Requirements
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) with the [Windows 10 Fall Creators Update SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
* *Fallback Layer* requires:
  * Windows 10 with the Fall Creators Update or higher.
  * Dx12 GPU with a driver that has retail DXIL support.
* *DirectX Raytracing* requires:
  * Windows 10 with the April 2018 update with DXR SDK overlay binaries. 
  * Dx12 gpu with a compatible DirectX Raytracing driver.
    * Nvidia: Volta or higher with 397.31+ driver.
    * Other vendors - please consult the vendor youâ€™re working with for HW and driver availability.
* Enable Developer Mode or sideload DXIL.dll from the latest Windows SDK to accompany the compiler.
* DXR SDK overlay binaries - download DirectXRaytracingBinariesV1.3.zip from https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/releases and copy all the contents to Samples/Desktop/D3D12Raytracing/tools/x64.

## Known limitations
  - NV: 397.31+ drivers do not properly support compute Fallback Layer on Nvidia Volta. Samples have artifacts and/or scenes miss altogether. Use the recommended DXR / driver based raytracing mode of samples on this configuration instead.
  - AMD: current/v1.3 revision of the DXR samples and Fallback Layer are not supported on AMD cards and will fail to run. You can use previous v1.1 source and binary overlay snapshots which work on AMD from the repository releases.

## Feedback and Questions
