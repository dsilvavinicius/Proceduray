# Bundles Sample
This sample demonstrates the use of Direct3D 12 Bundles. An app can use Bundles to group a small number of API commands together for execution later. When a Bundle is created, the driver will perform as much pre-processing as possible to make it inexpensive to execute the Bundle later. Part of this pre-processing means that there are certain restrictions on what operations can be performed within a Bundle.

### Optional Features
This sample has been updated to build against the Windows 10 Anniversary Update SDK. In this SDK a new revision of Root Signatures is available for Direct3D 12 apps to use. Root Signature 1.1 allows for apps to declare when descriptors in a descriptor heap won't change or the data descriptors point to won't change.  This allows the option for drivers to make optimizations that might be possible knowing that something (like a descriptor or the memory it points to) is static for some period of time.
