# Execute Indirect Sample
This sample demostrates how to generate dynamic GPU workloads using the graphics command list's ExecuteIndirect API. In this sample, a large number of triangles animate across the screen and a compute shader is used to determine which triangles are visible. The draw calls for those triangles are then aggregated into a buffer that is processed by the ExecuteIndirect API so that only those triangles are processed by the graphics pipeline.
